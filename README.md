### Discussion ###

This is a web browser with multiple tabs backed by `WKWebView`. The unique feature of this browser is the ability for the user to add their own JavaScript extensions to the browser. The app is also capable of using its own builtin extensions. Currently the only one is a script to look for the touch icons of a website and return it back to the app to use for the icon on the tab and favorites. The app uses the Realm database to store extensions, history, favorites, and browsing sessions.

The code editor for the extensions has syntax highlighting and auto indentation. So that's pretty neat.
